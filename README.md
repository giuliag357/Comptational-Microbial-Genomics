# Computational Microbial Genomics

## Project Description  
This project aims to analyze Metagenome-Assembled Genomes (MAGs) from a dental plaque species-level genome bin (SGB). By leveraging computational metagenomics techniques, the project explores microbial diversity, taxonomic classification, and potential links between microbiome composition and peri-implant diseases.  

## Objectives  
- Perform quality checking of MAGs  
- Assign taxonomic classifications  
- Conduct genome annotation  
- Analyze pangenomes to study genetic diversity  
- Perform phylogenetic analysis to understand evolutionary relationships  
- Investigate associations between microbial composition and host metadata
